Follow these best practices to maximize Apinni's benefits, ensure maintainability, and avoid common pitfalls.

<Admonition type="info" title="Overview">
Apinni promotes type safety and modularity; these practices help integrate it smoothly into your workflow.
</Admonition>

## Project Structure

- **Organize Controllers**: Group by domain (e.g., `src/controllers/users`, `src/controllers/auth`).
- **Use Domains**: Apply `@ApinniDomain` for logical grouping in generated types.
- **Separate Concerns**: Keep business logic out of controllers; use services.

## Workflow Tips

- **Watch Mode in Dev**: Always use `--watch` for instant feedback.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Run `apinni` in build pipelines to ensure types are up-to-date.
- **Version Control**: Commit generated types or regenerate on deploy.

## Performance

- **Limit Scans**: Use precise `include` patterns.
- **Caching**: Leverage TypeScript's incremental compilation.
- **Large Projects**: Split into modules or use plugins for optimization.

## Security and Maintenance

- **Disable Sensitive Endpoints**: Use `@ApinniDisabled` for control generated APIs.
- **Plugin Management**: Keep plugins updated; test dependencies.
- **Documentation**: Use plugins like Swagger for auto-docs.

<Admonition type="tip">
Combine with linting rules to enforce decorator usage.
</Admonition>

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to compile before generation when passing `--use-existing-build` flag.
- Mismatched or wrong `tsconfig.json` settings.
- Overly broad plugins leading to conflicts.

<Admonition type="warning">
Always test generated types in your client apps.
